Developed using Python, a Forest Fire Prediction System was crafted, utilizing a Random
Forest Classifier model. This system, deployed through Flask, accurately predicts the
probability of fire outbreaks in targeted regions. By analyzing various environmental
factors, it provides invaluable insights to aid in early detection and prevention efforts.
This innovative solution showcases the seamless integration of machine learning
techniques with web deployment for efficient and timely decision-making in fire
management strategies.
