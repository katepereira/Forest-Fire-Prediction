        <h2>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li> <b> Stay Calm:</b> Try to remain as calm as possible. Panic can impair judgment and decision-making.</li>
            <li><b>Call Emergency Services:</b> Dial the emergency services number immediately to report the fire. Provide your location and any relevant details about the fire's location and size.
            </li>
            <li>           <b> Evacuate Immediately:</b> If you are in the path of the fire, leave the area as quickly and safely as possible. Follow designated evacuation routes, if available.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Follow Authorities' Instructions:</b> Stay tuned to local radio or TV stations for updates and evacuation orders. Follow the instructions given by emergency personnel.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Inform Others:</b> If you know of others in the area, inform them about the fire and the need to evacuate if they are unaware.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Wear Protective Clothing:</b> If you must evacuate through smoke or fire, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, a hat, goggles, and a handkerchief or filter mask to protect your lungs.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Close Windows and Doors:</b> If you leave your home, close all windows and doors to prevent drafts. Open dampers in fireplaces but close fireplace screens.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Shut Off Gas:</b> Turn off the gas supply at the source before leaving your property if authorities advise you to do so.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Take Important Documents:</b> If time allows, take important documents like identification, insurance papers, medical records, and prescriptions.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Create a Safety Zone:</b> If escape routes are cut off and you cannot evacuate, create a safety zone in a cleared area away from trees, brush, and other flammable materials. Clear a space down to bare soil around you.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Stay Low:</b> If you are trapped in smoke, get down as low to the ground as possible, especially if you are having trouble breathing.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Stay Informed:</b> Keep listening to emergency broadcasts for updates on the fireâ€™s location and behavior.
            </li>
            <li>            <b>Do Not Return Home Until Cleared:</b> Do not return home until authorities declare the area safe. Even after the fire is out, there can be hazards such as hot spots and unstable structures.
            </li>
